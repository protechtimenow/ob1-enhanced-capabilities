# OB-1 Agent Wallet Configuration

## üîê Agent Wallet Setup

### Primary OB-1 Key (Controller Wallet):
```
Address: 0x21cC30462B8392Aa250453704019800092a16165
Role: Main controller for OB-1 agent operations
Usage: Primary authentication and transaction signing
```

## ü§ñ Agent-Assigned Wallets Strategy

### Option 1: Create New Dedicated Agent Wallets
Best for isolated agent operations and security:

```bash
# Create new wallets in MetaMask for each agent function
Agent-Analytics:  [Generate new wallet]
Agent-Trading:    [Generate new wallet] 
Agent-Governance: [Generate new wallet]
Agent-Operations: [Generate new wallet]
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete isolation of agent functions
- Clear audit trails for each agent type
- Reduced risk exposure
- Easy permission management

### Option 2: Use Existing Unused Wallets
If you have established but unused MetaMask wallets:

```bash
# Assign existing wallets to specific agent roles
Wallet-2: Agent-Analytics
Wallet-3: Agent-Trading
Wallet-4: Agent-Governance
```

**Benefits:**
- No new wallet creation needed
- May have existing transaction history (if desired)
- Established addresses

## üöÄ OB-1 Enhanced Integration

### Wallet Configuration in Agent:

```python
# Agent wallet configuration
AGENT_WALLETS = {
    "controller": "0x21cC30462B8392Aa250453704019800092a16165",
    "analytics": "",  # To be assigned
    "trading": "",    # To be assigned
    "operations": "", # To be assigned
    "governance": ""  # To be assigned
}
```

### Security Best Practices:

1. **Private Key Management**: Never store private keys in code
2. **Environment Variables**: Use secure env vars for wallet access
3. **Role-Based Permissions**: Each wallet has specific function permissions
4. **Multi-Signature**: Consider multi-sig for high-value operations

### MCP Server Integration:

Your OB-1 agent can now:
- Monitor wallet balances across all assigned wallets
- Execute transactions through appropriate agent wallets
- Provide analytics on wallet performance
- Automate cross-wallet operations

## üîß Implementation Steps:

1. **Create/Assign Agent Wallets**: Generate or select existing unused wallets
2. **Configure Environment**: Add wallet addresses to OB-1 config
3. **Set Permissions**: Define what each agent wallet can do
4. **Test Integration**: Verify wallet connectivity and functionality
5. **Deploy Security**: Implement monitoring and alerts

**Next Step**: Please specify if you prefer creating new wallets or using existing unused ones, and I'll update the agent configuration accordingly.
